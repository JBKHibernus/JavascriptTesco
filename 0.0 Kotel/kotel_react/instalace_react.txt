Step 3. Open a Terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your React project. (We covered how to do this in previous parts of the course, if this is confusing, I recommend skipping this lesson and continuing with the videos and using CodeSandbox).



Step 4. Create a Vite app by running the following command in your Terminal or Command Prompt:

npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react


Step 5. The first time, you won't have Vite installed. Type y to proceed. Then you'll be asked to select a framework. Use your down arrow to select React.

Step 6. You'll be asked to select a variant, select Javascript.

Step 7. Change directory to the new app that you built.

cd my-react-app


Step 8. Install dependencies:

npm install

Step 9. Start the development server:

npm run dev

Vite will compile your code every time your change anything and you can see the location of your development server in the output.


Step 10. Open the app in your browser by heading over to the local address shown. It's usually at http://localhost:5173/

You can now work on this local version and Vite will automatically recompile your code as you make changes.
